# TODOs

- If using the proximity sensor, no Bluetooth data will be recorded, since we can't scan in the background other than for a specific UUID. Any work around?
- Add mode to TX iBeacon
- Update Bluetooth logged data to include everything advertised (TX level, timetamp, etc.)
- Update table to replace "far" decisions with "close" ones if it's out of space (limit of 10 devices in the table)
- Give option to disable local detection processing (save CPU cycles)
- Name log file with timestamp and automate sending it to a shared folder somewhere (Google Drive?)
- Add hysteresis for decisions
- Add confidence for decisions
- Add range estimation
