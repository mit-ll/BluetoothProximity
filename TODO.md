# TODOs

- Add ability to annotate test
- Button to clear log file
- Tabbed UI with more clear test procedures
- Any RSSI > 20 is invalid per Bluetooth spec - maybe don't log those
- Get app in TestFlight
- If using the proximity sensor, no Bluetooth data will be recorded, since we can't scan in the background other than for a specific UUID
	- Example here: https://scribles.net/enabling-background-ble-scanning-on-iphone/
- Add TX mode
	- Specific UUID so RX can only scan for that
	- iBeacon
- Sort detector table by results (close, far)
- Name log file with timestamp and automate sending it to a shared folder somewhere
- Add confidence metric
- Add range estimation
- Log battery state (charging vs. not)
- Log screen state
- If we're no longer getting measurements from a device, it gets stuck close/far. add last contact in seconds.
- Button for H0/H1 for labeling test
- Log pedometer
