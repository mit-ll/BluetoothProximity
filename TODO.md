# TODOs

- Update Bluetooth logged data to include everything advertised (TX level, timetamp, etc.)
- Can we detect screen state on/off?
- Update table to replace "far" decisions with "close" ones if it's out of space (limit of 10 devices in the table)
- Give option to disable local detection processing (save CPU cycles)
- Add start/stop button for running everything
- Name log file with timestamp and automate sending it to a shared folder somewhere (Google Drive?)
- Automatically log device info (type of phone, any Bluetooth chip info)
- Add text field & button to set and log current range truth
- Add hysteresis for decisions
- Add confidence for decisions
- Add range estimation
