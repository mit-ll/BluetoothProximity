### Introduction
**MIT PACT:** **P**rivate **A**utomated **C**ontact **T**racing is committed to supporting the privacy of its users. This Privacy Statement explains how we handle and use the information you provide through the use of the **BlueProx** measurement app and **BluetoothProximity** beta research app.  

### What information we collect 
We collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of information, which we have grouped together as follows:  
*	**Basic** biographic/contact information – email address
*	**Bluetooth** – time-stamped records of nearby Bluetooth devices and signal strength
*	**Device state** - if provided by you, motion- and environment-related data from your phone
*	**Location** (BluetoothProximity only)– if provided by you, geo-location data sourced from your phone
*	**Sound** (BluetoothProximity only)– if provided by you, acoustic beacon signals sourced from your phone
 
### How we collect personal information about you 
We collect this information directly from you and not from any other source. 
  
### How we use your personal information
We use your information for a number of legitimate purposes all in support of MIT PACT and its mission.  Specifically, we use your information to:
*	Characterize Bluetooth radio frequency (RF) phenomenology
*	Develop algorithms for estimating the duration and range of proximate contact between Bluetooth devices

If you have concerns about any of these purposes, or how we communicate with you, please contact our privacy officer at David.Suski@ll.mit.edu. 

### When we share your personal information
To perform the functions listed above, it may be necessary to share anonymized, de-identified and/or aggregated information with other researchers.  We will never share your email address or any other personal information you may provide while using this App or when communicating with us.

### How your information is stored and secured
MIT uses risk-assessed administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your personal information. The specific measures we employ include encryption in transit, controls to limit access to services or systems that contain sensitive data, storage on secure (password and firewall-protected) servers inside physically-secure facilities, encryption for data at rest outside physically-secure facilities, and procedures to handle any suspected security incidents.

### How long we keep your personal information
Data will be retained for less than two years from the date of collection. After the applicable retention period, all identifiable data will be deleted and only anonymized, de-identified and/or aggregated data will be retained.

### Additional Information
We may change this Privacy Statement from time to time.  If we make any significant changes in the way we treat your personal information we will make this clear on our MIT websites or by contacting you directly.
